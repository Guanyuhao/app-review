This Privacy Policy applies to Cold Wallet (hereinafter referred to as "this App").  
We take your privacy and personal information protection very seriously. This policy explains how we collect, use, share, store, and protect your information, as well as your rights.

## 1. What Data We Collect

We are committed to minimizing data collection. This app is an offline cold wallet with no network access by default.

### 1.1 What We Don't Collect

- We do not collect your name, phone number, ID information, or other identity information
- We do not collect your transaction records (on-chain data is broadcast by you on the blockchain network)
- We do not collect your mnemonic phrases/private keys (mnemonic phrases are generated and stored locally on your device)
- We do not perform advertising tracking or cross-app tracking

### 1.2 Local Device Storage (Only on Your Device)

To enable wallet functionality, we store the following locally on your device:

- Mnemonic phrases/wallet key materials (**encrypted** and stored in system secure storage/app data directory)
- App settings (such as language, theme, biometric unlock toggle, etc.)

The above content is stored only locally on your device and is not uploaded to our servers.

## 2. Permission Usage

### 2.1 Camera Permission

Purpose: Scanning QR codes (address input, importing unsigned transactions, displaying signature results to hot wallets).

### 2.2 Biometric (Face ID / Touch ID)

Purpose: Used to unlock the app (optional). Biometric verification is handled by the system; we do not obtain or save your biometric information.

## 3. Data Security

We take reasonable technical measures to protect your data security:

- Critical data encrypted storage (e.g., AES-256-GCM)
- Use of system security mechanisms (e.g., iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- Minimize the residence time of sensitive data in memory

## 4. Third-Party Services

This app does not integrate third-party advertising SDKs and does not use third-party tracking services.

## 5. Children's Privacy

This app does not provide services to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect children's personal information.
